        <div>Defining the REST API

            <p>I. The Clueless's clients will require the services bellow:
            <ol>

<li>Create a player by name (or ID)

<li>Delete a player by name (or ID)

<li>Update a player location by {name and location}

<li>Get the next validation location based on the player current location {name and location} 
            </ol>

<p>II. Based on these requirements, the server will provide REST APIs for the services:
<ol>
 <li>/api/player/{name}
   <br>Returns new player name and init location

  <li> /api/player/1
   <br> Delete  player identified by id (employee 1 in this case)

  <li>  /api/player/1/update
  <br> Update player location

  <li> /api/player/1/nextvalidposition
  <br>  Returns all validation location (employee 1 in this case)
</ol>
</p>
</div>
    </body>
